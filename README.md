I research scalable and principled methods for aligning large generative models. In the past, I worked at [FAIR Labs at Meta](https://research.facebook.com/), [Google DeepMind](https://ai.google/) and [StanfordAI](https://ai.stanford.edu/). I'm a graduate of CS, Math, and Stats at the University of Toronto where I began learning about latent variable models and probabilistic inference at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I'm seeking full-time ML research and engineering roles in 2023.

Like my models, I'm still learning (:
