I'm an undergrad in CS, Math, and Stats at University of Toronto. I research latent variable models, neural ODEs/SDEs, and score-based generative models with [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I'm also spending time at [@Google-Brain](https://ai.google/) with [Igor Mordatch](https://twitter.com/IMordatch). Previously, I researched Transformers and language models [@Cohere.ai](https://cohere.ai), and developed deep learning tools for robotics [@NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/omniverse/). Like my models, I'm still learning (:
