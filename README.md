I research generative models, neural compression, and LLMs in collaboration with [FAIR Labs at Meta AI](https://research.facebook.com/), [Google-Brain](https://ai.google/) and [StanfordAI](https://ai.stanford.edu/). I'm a recent graduate of CS, Math, and Stats at the University of Toronto where I began learning about latent variable models and probabilistic inference at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I'm seeking full-time ML research and engineering roles in 2023.

Previously, I scaled Transfomers on human-generated content at [@Cohere.ai](https://cohere.ai) and developed deep learning tools for robotics [@NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/omniverse/). Like my models, I'm still learning (:
