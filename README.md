I'm an undergrad in CS, Math, and Stats at University of Toronto. Currently a robotics and deep learning intern [@NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/omniverse/), previously an rSWE intern [@Google-Brain](https://ai.google/), soon-to-be ML researcher at [:eyes:](https://cohere.ai). I also research latent variable models, neural ODEs/SDEs, robustness, and Bayesian deep learning with [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I'm still learning (:
