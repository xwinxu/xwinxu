I'm an undergrad in CS, Math, and Stats at University of Toronto. Currently an ML researcher [@Cohere.ai](https://cohere.ai), recently a robotics and deep learning intern [@NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/omniverse/), and previously an rSWE intern [@Google-Brain](https://ai.google/). I also research latent variable models, neural ODEs/SDEs, distributional robustness, and Bayesian neural networks with [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Like my models, I'm still learning (:
