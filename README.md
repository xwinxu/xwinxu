I research generative models and LLMs in collaboration with [@Google-Brain](https://ai.google/) and [@StanfordAI](https://ai.stanford.edu/). I'm a recent graduate of CS, Math, and Stats at the University of Toronto where I worked on latent variable models, probabilistic inference, and neural ODEs/SDE at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I'm seeking PhD oppys for 2023.

Previously, I scaled Transfomers on human-generated content at [@Cohere.ai](https://cohere.ai) and developed deep learning tools for robotics [@NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/omniverse/). Like my models, I'm still learning (:
